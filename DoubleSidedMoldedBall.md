# Global Double Sided Molded Ball Grid Array Package Market 2023-2030
The global double-sided molded ball grid array (BGA) package market represents a specialized segment within the semiconductor packaging industry. Double-sided molded BGA packages are used in electronic devices to house integrated circuits (ICs) and other electronic components, providing a compact and efficient solution for mounting on printed circuit boards (PCBs).  An integrated circuit is packaged using a surface-mount device called a Double Sided Molded Ball Grid Array Package, sometimes known as a chip carrier. Devices like microprocessors are permanently mounted using Double Sided Molded Ball Grid Array Package. A Double Sided Molded Ball Grid Array Package can offer more connector pins than a dual in-line or flat package can accommodate. Instead of simply the edge, the entire bottom surface of the gadget can be used. Additionally, compared to a perimeter-only type, the traces connecting the package’s leads to the wires or balls that connect the die to the package are typically shorter, improving performance at high speeds. Here’s a detailed overview of the market:

1. Market Overview

Amkor has created a Double Sided Molded Ball Grid Array (DSMBGA) package that enables molded assembly of components on both sides of the substrate in order to further enhance the integration and resilience of RFFE solutions. In order to package RF front-end modules for smartphones and other 5G-enabled devices, creative solutions are needed because the cellular frequency bands have expanded significantly with the development of 5G. One of the best examples of such solutions is Amkor’s Double Sided Molded Ball Grid Array Package. Amkor was the first OSAT to offer DSMBGA, building on years of experience in providing top-tier innovative System in Package (SiP) technology, and it continues to pave the way for new developments.
The level of integration for RF front-end modules used in smartphones and other mobile devices has significantly risen thanks to Amkor’s double-sided packaging method. Low noise amplifiers (LNA), power amplifiers, RF switches, RF filters, and duplexes make up the majority of RF front-end modules.With compartmental or conformal shielding, the Double Sided Molded Ball Grid Array Package enables the molded assembly of active, passive, and antenna tuner components on both sides of the substrate.

6. Future Outlook
Market Growth: The market for double-sided molded BGAs is expected to grow as demand for compact, high-performance electronic devices continues to increase.
