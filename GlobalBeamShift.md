A beam splitter, also known as a beam splitter or power splitter, is an optical device that divides an incident light beam, such as a laser beam, into two (or more) beams, each of which may or may not have the same optical power (radiant flux).
 
As explained in the following, there are various kinds of beam splitters; the plate and cube beam splitters are the most significant ones. They serve incredibly disparate functions. Beam splitters are necessary for a variety of interferometers, autocorrelation, cameras, projectors, and laser systems, for instance.
 
Multiple types of splitters can be used to meet the large variety of applicationsâ€™ differing requirements.
 
While some beam splitters are non-polarizing, some are. A laser beam, which is typically linearly polarised, as the input, is one example of a device made for use with only one polarisation direction.
 
Others are made for broadband operation, such as working across the entire visible wavelength region, while some devices only operate in a limited wavelength range (such as the area surrounding a common laser line). Similar to this, beam splitters might only work effectively with a limited range of incidence angles.
 
Between various device types, the optical losses differ dramatically. In contrast, devices with dichroic coatings may have low losses, meaning that the total output power is almost equal to the input power. As an illustration, beam splitters with metallic coatings have rather substantial losses.
